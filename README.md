Android Plum Calculator: 


Implemented a plum calculator android application. Developed the calculator UI and logic using android activities, layouts and UI elements. Calculator supports multiple operations and commands in a sequence and it only uses the last operand if multiple operands are entered consecutively. Error handling and self-correction was also well taken care of.
